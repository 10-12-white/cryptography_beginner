# Progress

## What left

### Components

- need to understand the BKZ 2.0 code base
- understand the dual implementation
- move from dual to dual intuitive
- is this new??
- work on dual bkz, understand code library
- introduce new changes, so that it is obvious what it is that you are trying to do
- lattice will be LWE based because that is the direciton that we want to be working in
- split algorithms
- understand the difference between dual, slide dual and the normal BKZ progress

  ### What I have done
  - presented at least once
  - worked on how I written parts of the work
  - included the notes of supervisors in these sections
  - worked on my understanding of mathematics
  -
