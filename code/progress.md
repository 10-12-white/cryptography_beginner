# Progress

## What left

### Components

- need to understand the BKZ 2.0 code base
- understand the dual implementation
- move from dual to dual intuitive
- is this new??
- work on dual bkz, understand code library
- introduce new changes, so that it is obvious what it is that you are trying to do
- lattice will be LWE based because that is the direciton that we want to be working in
- split algorithms
